# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Labs within the course ID1021

The course was taken during the fall semester 2022 at KTH and these are the labs that the course revolved around.
The lab reports contain key information about how the algorithms are constructed, different methods of implementing algorithms and their difference in efficiency.
The code together with the reports are all written by me personally (with the exception of eventually given skeleton code from the teacher) posted here. 

# DO NOT COPY THIS INFORMATION
Rather use this provided documentation to get a more vivid picture of how the algorithms work and could be implemented if you are taking this course with similiar labs.
